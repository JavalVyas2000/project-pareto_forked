    The model has 68785 variables and 99615 constraints
    with 446549 Jacobian elements, 18968 of which are nonlinear.
    The Hessian of the Lagrangian has 0 elements on the diagonal,
    6032 elements below the diagonal, and 9152 nonlinear variables.
 
 ** Warning **  The value of LFITER is out of range.
                LFITER is decreased from 2147483647 to 1000000000.

 ** Infeasible solution. Reduced gradient less than tolerance.
 
 
 ** Warning **  All Jacobian elements in the rows marked below are
                less than the absolute pivot tolerance 1.0E-10 (Rtpiva)
                in the final point. Only slacks or artificials can
                be basic in these rows.
                A better scaling or better bounds on the variables
                may help the optimization.

--- DICOPT: Relaxed NLP is infeasible

      The Relaxed NLP was infeasible. Please check your model and
      make sure it solves correctly as an RMINLP model. Also
      consider switching to a different RMINLP solver.
